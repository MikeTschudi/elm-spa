### what is elm-spa?

__elm-spa__ is a framework for building web apps in Elm. It's not a "framework" like React or VueJS, it's more of a framework like NextJS, Rails, or .NET MVC.

It provides simple tooling and a convention for creating single page apps, so you can focus on the cool thing you want to build!
